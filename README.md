# Cypress Tests

## Overview
This repository demonstrates modern web automation using **Cypress** (JavaScript). It highlights:
- Browser automation for interactive web workflows
- UI testing: filling forms, clicking buttons, navigating pages
- Test-driven mindset for validating web functionality

This repo reflects foundational automation skills that directly translate into Python-based tools (e.g., Playwright, Selenium, Requests scripting).
